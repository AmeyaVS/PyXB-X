This directory contains groups of bindings for related schema.  Each
subdirectory represents a particular group.

With a bundle directory, the following are expected:

- A scripts directory, containing an executable genbind which retrieves the
  schema and invokes pyxbgen to build the bindings

- A schemas directory, into which the genbind script stores the schemas that
  were used to build the bindings

- The Python module files for namespace modules.  Normally these are
  customization wrappers

- A raw subdirectory, into which the generated bindings are placed

- An examples directory, with programs that show how to use the capabilities
  in the bundle

- A tests directory which validates customizations
