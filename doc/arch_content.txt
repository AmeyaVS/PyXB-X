Content Model
=============

PyXB's content model is used to complete the link between the
:ref:`componentModel` and the :ref:`bindingModel`.  These classes are the
ones that:

- determine what Python class attribute is used to store which XML
  element or attribute; 
- distinguish those elements that can occur at most once from those that
  require an aggregation; and
- ensure that the ordering and occurrence constraints imposed by the XML
  `model group <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#Model_Groups>`_ are
  satisfied, when XML is converted to Python instances and vice-versa.

The classes involved in the content model are in the
:api:`pyxb.binding.content` module, and their relationships are displayed in
the following diagram.

Associating XML and Python Objects
----------------------------------

In the standard code generation template, both element and attribute values
are stored in Python class fields.  As noted in
:ref:`binding_deconflictingNames` it is necessary to ensure an attribute and
an element which have the same name in their containing complex type have
distinct names in the Python class corresponding to that type.  Use
information for each of these is maintained in the type class.  This use
information comprises:

- the original name of the element/attribute in the XML
- its deconflicted name in Python
- the private name by which the value is stored in the Python instance dictionary

Other information is specific to the type of use.  The
:api:`pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition` retains maps from the
component's name the attribute use or element use instance corresponding to
the component's use.

.. _attributeUse:

Attribute Uses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The information associated with an `attribute use
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#cAttributeUse>`_ is recorded in a
:api:`pyxb.binding.content.AttributeUse` instance.  This class provides:

- The type of the attribute, as a subclass of
  :api:`pyxb.binding.basis.simpleTypeDefinition`
- The default value of the attribute
- Whether the `attribute use
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#cAttributeUse>`_ is 
  ``required`` or ``prohibited``
- Whether the attribute value is ``fixed``

A :api:`map <pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition._AttributeMap>` is used
to map from (future namespace extended) names to AttributeUse instances.  This
map is defined within the class definition itself.

Element Uses
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The element analog to an attribute use is an `element declaration
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#cElement_Declarations>`_, and the
corresponding information is stored in a
:api:`pyxb.binding.content.ElementUse` instance.  This class contains an
indication of whether multiple element instances can be associated with the
use; this drives whether the default value is ``None`` or an empty list.

Content Model Automata
----------------------

The XML `model group <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#Model_Groups>`_
construct permits a nested specification of legal type instances through
ordered sequences (``sequence``), conjunctions or unordered sequences
(``all``), choices (``choice``), and wildcards (``any``).  The model group can
be considered a form of regular expression, and as such we use `Thompson's
algorithm <http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=363387>`_ to construct a
non-deterministic finite automaton which recognizes the set of conforming
documents.  A `powerset construction
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction>`_ is then used to make
the automaton deterministic, and the resulting automaton is stored as a
:api:`pyxb.binding.content.ContentModel` instance, with a set of :api:`states
<pyxb.binding.content.ContentModelState>` each of which has :api:`transitions
<pyxb.binding.content.ContentModelTransition>` on elements and wildcards.

The sole complication in the automaton construction is dealing with with
``all`` model groups, which accept subsets of a set of nodes in any order.
This construct produces an exponential increase in the size of the
deterministic finite automaton, so is left as a single :api:`transition
<pyxb.binding.content.ModelGroupAll>` which iteratively matches against the
head of the node list until all alternatives have been matched or the head
fails to match an alternative.

The binding instance is then constructed by identifying the content model for
the corresponding complex type, then walking the model using a sequence of DOM
nodes to select the appropriate transition.  Element matches are prefered over
``all`` matches, which in turn are preferred over wildcard matches.
