Limitations
***********

Things That Work
----------------

* Class constants corresponding to string enumeration constraints

* Simple and complex type definitions

* List and union datatypes

* Constraints on (simple) datatypes (e.g., minInclusive, length)

* Model groups and attribute groups

* Complex content models (all, sequence, choice); minOccurs and maxOccurs

* Most everything that isn't in the next section.

Things That Don't Work
----------------------

...but should soon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Substitution groups are not supported.  This is expected to be addressed
  in the next major release.

* The XMLSchema instance attributes (xsi:nil, xsi:type) are not currently
  supported.  It is relatively clear how to do so, though, and this will be
  addressed in the next major release.

* Pattern constraints don't do anything.

* The only date/time-related datatype that is implemented in this release is
  dateTime.

* Documentation present in the schema is not made available in the bindings
  (viz., I want the annotations to become docstrings).

* When generating a DOM instance from a binding instance, the resulting
  document should validate against the schema, but the order of elements
  within it may be different from the original order of creation.  For an
  example of this, see
  tests/test-mg-choice:TestMGChoice.testMultichoiceOrderImportant

...and probably never will
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The redefine directive is not supported.

* Identity constraints ("key", "unique", "keyref") are stored in the content
  model, but are not used.

* Wildcards ("any") elements are supported in the sense that classes that
  enable them in the content model provide access to unrecognized DOM
  instances through the
  :api:`pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition.wildcardElements` method.
  However, neither the namespace constraint nor process contents attributes
  are applied.

* Wildcard ("any") attributes are supported in the same sense as wildcard
  elements: no constraints are checked, and all are aggregated into the
  :api:`pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition.wildcardAttributeMap`.

Things That Mostly Work, But They're Ugly
-----------------------------------------

* Cross-namespace attribute handling and attribute namespace identification
  needs a thorough overhaul, due to misunderstandings when PyXB was being
  developed.

* There are two content models: the DFA that's used to convert from DOM to
  binding instances, and an older model based on sequences of visible
  elements which is used to convert from binding instances to DOM.  Both
  models were kept because of a fear that generation would require
  non-determinism; I now suspect that's wrong, and there's no reason why
  generation can't be accomplished using the DFA content model.  This is
  expected to change in a future release.

* The ability to use templates to customize binding generation was promised
  in the vision document.  That has not yet been done, though it should be
  fairly straightforward.

* Very complex schemas for which it is necessary to save a component model
  run afoul of a long-running Python bug when pickling deep structures
  (http://bugs.python.org/issue3338 and many related issues).  There may be
  a way to work around that by reducing the complexity of the pickled
  components

* Processing of include and import directives is a little too fragile.

Intended Near-Term Enhancements
-------------------------------

* Use the :api:`new content model <pyxb.binding.content.ContentModel>` to
  generate DOM instances from objects

* Implement `xsi:type <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#xsi_type>`_

* Support `substitution groups
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#key-equivalenceClass>`_

* Support custom generation templates
