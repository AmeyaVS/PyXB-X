Simple Type Definitions
=======================

STDs are represented by subclasses of Python built-in types, augmented with
facets.

Local STDs are assigned a protected-scope name that is unique within their
namespace.

Primitive STDs
--------------

Primitive STDs are the ones in the XMLSchema datatypes list, and are
built-in to PyWXSB.

Restrictions
------------

Simple type definitions formed by restriction inherit from the base type
definition.  Any facets defined for the given STD are created as class
variables using standard names.  The STD is also given a list of all facets
that affect it; some of these may be in the STD, and some in superclasses.

Enumeration facets will add class variables corresponding to each
enumeration value.  The prefix for the class variable corresponding to an
enumeration may be configured at code-generation time.

Complex Type Definitions
========================

A complex type definition is either an extension or a restriction of either
a simple or complex type.

Particle
========

A particle is a a ModelGroup, Wildcard, or ElementDeclaration with an
associated cardinality range.

Model Groups
============

Model groups represent an all, sequence, or choice among a group of
particles.
