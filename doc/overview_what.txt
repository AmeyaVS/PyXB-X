What Is PyXB?
=============

PyXB is a pure `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package that generates
Python code for classes that correspond to data structures defined by
`XMLSchema <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>`_.  In concept it is similar to
`JAXB <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXB>`_ for Java and `CodeSynthesis XSD
<http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/>`_ for C++.

The major goals of PyXB are:

* Provide a generated Python interface that is "Pythonic", meaning similar
  to one that would have been hand-written:

  + Attributes and elements are Python fields (currently accessed through
    inspector/mutator methods), with name conflicts resolved in favor of
    elements
  + Elements with maxOccurs larger than 1 are stored as Python lists
  + Bindings for type extensions inherit from the binding for the base type
  + Enumeration constraints are exposed as class (constant) variables

* Support bi-directional conversion (DOM to Python and back)

* Allow easy customization of the generated bindings to provide
  functionality along with content

* Support all XMLSchema features that are in common use, including:

  + complex content models (nested all/choice/sequence)
  + cross-namespace dependencies
  + include and import directives
  + constraints on simple types

Secondary goals, some of which have been achieved in the current release, are
listed in :ref:`pyxb_vision`.

Examples of Processable Schema
------------------------------

PyXB can parse the following namespaces and create bindings for them (though
not all have been rigorously tested).  For examples of how to use PyXB with
schemas like these, see :ref:`examples`.
