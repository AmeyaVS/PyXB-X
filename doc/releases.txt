Release History
***************

The release number of PyXB indicates stability in a way similar to that of
Linux several years ago:

- All releases consist of three non-negative integers

- If the second integer is even, the release is considered *stable*:

  - All documentation will be current, all supported platforms tested, all
    tests pass, all examples verified

  - Bugs will be fixed if this can be done without changing behavior that
    somebody may depend on

  - No new interface capabilities will be added

  Releases in a stable series are intended for production applications where
  stability is the highest consideration.

- If the second integer is odd, the release is considered *beta*:

  - Interfaces will change between releases, sometimes significantly

  - Any given release may fail to pass certain tests or not work on certain
    platforms

  - User and API documentation may be incomplete or incorrect

  Releases in a beta series are intended for development of new applications
  with functionality requirements that cannot be satisfied by the current
  stable series.  Users of beta series get increased functionality, but more
  pain.

0.5.x (Beta)
============

0.5.0 (07 Jul 2009, rev ????)
-----------------------------

Ability to parse many of the OpenGIS schemas (gml, iso19139, citygml, ogc,
ogckml22, om, ows, sensorML, sos, swe, tml, ...).

- Completely rework include and import directives to correctly handle relative
  paths in ``schemaLocation`` attributes and to only import from a given
  location once per namespace. :ticket:`9`, :ticket:`8`, :ticket:`5`

- Parse ``final`` attribute on type definitions (though this has no effect on
  the bindings).  :ticket:`10`

- Complete missing implementations in complex types with simple content.
  :ticket:`6`

- Create new code generation model which supports inter-namespace and
  inter-schema dependency cycles.  Namespace archives can now holds all
  namespaces that depend on each other.

- Other miscellaneous. :ticket:`11`

- Did I mention the ability to handle OpenGIS?  :ticket:`16`

Beware:

- Most of the classes in the new code generation model are undocumented.

- The interface to `pyxbgen` has changed completely.  Look at
  ``examples/OpenGIS/makebind.sh`` or other scripts in the ``examples``
  directory.


0.4.x (Stable)
==============

0.4.0 (20 Jun 2009, rev 1204)
-----------------------------

First usable public release.

- Use expanded names for all declarations and definitions. :ticket:`1`

- Use the finite automaton content model for generation as well as
  parsing. :ticket:`2`

- Support xsi:type and xsi:nil. :ticket:`3` 

- Support substitution groups. :ticket:`4` 

- Fix many problems in QName resolution

- Implement the remaining date/time types

- Rework content model so binding instances are always instances of the
  binding for the corresponding XML type, with no intervening element
  instance

- Add support for SAX parser

0.2.x (Stable)
==============

0.2.0 (30 May 2009, rev 818)
