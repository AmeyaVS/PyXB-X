The Python structures that hold schema-related data are directly related to
the schema components defined in the XMLSchema specification.

Design Choices
==============

PyWXSB
------

Most XMLSchema are relatively small, so holding the entire definition in
memory is not an issue.  The complexity of XMLSchema can require multiple
passes over the data type definitions to resolve forward references.  As a
consequence of these points, the Document Object Model was selected as the
internal representation of XML within PyWXSB.  Level 2 DOM conformance is
assumed.

Though PyWXSB currently uses the xml.dom.minidom implementation, there is no
intention to rely on any implementation-specific features of this.  It is,
however, assumed that certain DOM constructs will be available in a
"Pythonic" manner.  For example, NodeList instances should support the
capabilities of a Python sequence rather than requiring invocation of the
item() method in an iteration up to the list length.

Generated Bindings
------------------

The default templates for generated code use the Document Object Model as
their source for instance documents.  They assume the implementation
supports a Pythonic interface.  If an implementation supports only a strict
DOM interface, a custom template may be required.
