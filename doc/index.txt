PyXB: Python XML Schema Bindings
################################

PyXB ("pixbee") is a pure `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package that
generates Python source code for classes that correspond to data structures
defined by `XMLSchema <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>`_.  The generated classes
support bi-directional conversion between `XML <http://www.w3.org/XML/>`_
documents and Python instances.  In concept it is similar to `JAXB
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXB>`_ for Java and `CodeSynthesis XSD
<http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/>`_ for C++.  A
:ref:`thirty_sec_example` is at the bottom of this page.

For downloads, support, etc. please see the `PyXB project page
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxb>`_ on SourceForge.

Thirty Second Example
*********************

An example of a program using PyXB to interact with a `web service
<http://wiki.cdyne.com/wiki/index.php?title=CDYNE_Weather>`_ using an
automatically-generated module.  First, retrieve the WSDL and generate the
bindings::

 vmfed9[23]$ pyxbgen -m weather -u 'http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?wsdl' -m weather -W

And run it::

 vmfed9[24]$ python client_get.py
