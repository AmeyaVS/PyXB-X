Coding Standards
================

PyWXSB follows generally follows coding practices consistent with those
described in the Python coding standard in PEP8.  However, the primary
maintainer's pet peeves on whitespace differ: spaces are used around
operators to reveal precedence assumptions, and around parenthesis to
distinguish tuple values boundaries:

    hypot2 = x*x + y*y
    pair_of_pairs = ( (a, b), (b, c) )

Other practices are an attempt to reflect in Python practices used in C++ to
explicitly reveal interface visibility.  The use of a double underscore in
Python to indicate private data, with the rest being public, makes too much
of the implementation details visible to the user.  A single underscore is
used to represent the concepts of protected/friend interfaces.

Exceptions
----------

PyWXSB provides a standard exception hierarchy that extends that built into
Python.

Where an execution branch has been identified that requires behavior that
has not yet been implemented, raise an IncompleteImplementationError.

Where the system detects that a precondition is not satisfied, processing
must stop.  If the precondition failure is due to improper use of the PyWXSB
internal or public API, a LogicError should be raised.  If the precondition
failure is due to invalid input from the schema, a SchemaValidationError
should be raised.

If the precondition is inexplicably false, Python's assert functionality may
be used.  (Use of assert should be rare, and only in places that are
guaranteed to be exercised during the course of testing.)

The exception behavior of methods SHOULD be documented.  Documentation of
asserts is not required.

Annotations
-----------

Use decorators to mark class methods.
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/.  Note that this restricts us to
Python 2.4 or later.  Sigh with disappointment and move on.

Documentation
-------------
Use docstrings for all public and implementation-shared methods and classes.
See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/.

Comments
--------

Use comments copiously.  Do not duplicate detailed information from
standards, but do include pertinent summaries and a reference to the section
in which the details can be found.  The casual reader should not be forced
to open the standard to figure out what the coder intended to accomplish.

Use ReStructured Text constructs where appropriate.
